        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>third eye : 🎯 Goal:
            To create a wearable device (like on a cap or glasses) that detects obstacles in front of the user and provides vibration feedback.</p>
            <p>pet food dispenser: 🎯 Goal:
                Automatically dispense a measured amount of pet food at set time intervals (or with a button/remote).</p
            <p>automatic car parking system: 🎯 Project Objective:
                To automate a car parking lot system where:
                Entry gate opens if space is available.
                IR/Ultrasonic sensors detect vehicle presence.
                Parking slots are tracked and displayed.
                
                Barrier gates are controlled using a servo motor</p>
            <p>bike security system:🛠️ Project Goal:
                To secure a bike by detecting key ignition status, sending alerts via call or message, and providing GPS location using NING board + ESP32-C3 (with A9G or other GSM/GPS modules).
                
                </p>
            <p>home automation:🎯 Goal:
                To control home appliances (ON/OFF) using Wi-Fi with ESP8266 (like NodeMCU), through a:
                Web page (hosted on ESP8266),
                or Blynk / MQTT / Alexa (optional).
                
                </p>
            <p>automatic switching:🎯 Goal:
                To automatically switch ON/OFF home appliances using SMS, call, or commands sent over a 4G connection using the SIM7670C module.</p>
            <p>multipurpose iot tracker:🎯 Project Objective:
                A portable IoT tracker that:
                Sends real-time location via GPS (SPI or UART based module).
                Has an SOS button for emergencies — sends location alert to a phone or server.
                Communicates over Wi-Fi, BLE, or 4G (if using SIM module).
                Optional: OLED display, buzzer, or LED status indicators.
                </p>
            <p>study buddy: A smart AI assistant using:
                📶 ESP32 as the central microcontroller
                🧠 Google Gemini AI API for natural language answers
                🎤🎧 Microphone + Speaker or TTS/STT modules for voice interaction
                💡 Optional: OLED Display / LEDs / Servo (for expression)</p>
